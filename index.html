                Sourav Gupta is a first-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI-ML) at Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology (SMIT). Dedicated, curious, and self-motivated, Sourav has been steadily building a strong foundation in both programming and personal growth. Before college began, he took the initiative to learn web development, mastering HTML and CSS early on, and later diving into JavaScript — exploring topics like callbacks, promises, and async/await. His growing curiosity for logic and computation also led him to start learning C programming, where he has already covered loops, strings, and arrays, and continues to strengthen his concepts semester by semester.

            <p style="color:white ; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
                Beyond academics, Sourav is someone deeply focused on self-improvement and discipline.
                 Over the past few months, he has successfully lost weight — dropping from 94 kg to under 90 kg — through a balanced routine of gym workouts four times a week and a careful high-protein, calorie-controlled diet.
                  He tracks his protein intake daily, often consuming boiled eggs, roasted chana, and whey protein to stay on target. His approach reflects a rare mix of consistency and commitment, as he keeps detailed logs of his diet, spending, and progress — all while managing college life.

                As a person, Sourav has a thoughtful and introspective nature. He values emotional honesty, and though he has faced moments of loneliness and betrayal in friendships, he continues to open up with sincerity and kindness.His empathy and emotional intelligence make him grounded and real in his interactions.
                Driven by ambition and curiosity, Sourav dreams of excelling in AI and software development, while staying disciplined in his physical and personal growth. He enjoys experimenting, learning new technologies, and improving step-by-step rather than rushing. His journey so far paints a picture of someone who combines technical passion, personal resilience, and emotional depth — a rare blend that makes him both relatable and inspiring.
